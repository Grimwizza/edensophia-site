      <p>Hey, I’m <strong>Eden Sophia</strong>. Most days, I’ve got paint on my
      hands and my AirPods in. I literally can’t create anything without music
      playing. I love the feel of sketching in a real notebook, but I’m also
      constantly drawing in Procreate on my iPad.</p><p>I’m planning to study
      business in college and minor in art. When I’m not drawing or painting,
      I’m usually listening to records, building a Lego set, or working out.
      Right now, I’m just focused on practicing new techniques and seeing where
      my art can go. I’m excited to keep exploring different styles and learning
      as much as I can along the way.</p>
